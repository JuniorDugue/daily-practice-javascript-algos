## [Closure](closure.js)
![closure](./assets/closure.png)
- here's a code example of closures
![example of closure](./assets/closure1.png)

## [This Keyword](thisKeyword.js)
- global window object return when console logging `this`since in this example we're not inside any other object

![global window object return when console logging `this`](./assets/this.jpg)

- `this` keyword references whatever object it's inside of, so if you just console.log(this) it'll out the global window object, but if you create an object, you can use `this` to reference any given property inside the { }

- few examples of using `this` keyword within a couple of {objects}
